Any message which is to be gossiped :
 <message, pk(sender), metadata to verify the signature>

To avoid gossiping a msg more than once --> keep track of all msgs and check if already gossiped.
When to gossip a message:
	1. 


Node objects 2000
obj1 sends meesage to obj2 : Event 1
obj2 verifies : Event 2
obj1 sends message to obj3: Event 3
Obj2 relays msg to obj3 : Event 4
obj1 sends to obj4 : Event 5
.
.
.
Events 1000


so message passing will execute like this : 
	obj1 sends to obj2 
	There is a queue between obj1 and obj2.obj1 adds msg to shared queue and obj2 picks up from there.(Producer - consumer type)
